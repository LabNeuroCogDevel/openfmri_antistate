# Data
77 subjects

## Demographics
see `00_getDemo.bash

initial demo file generated in `/data/Luna1/openfmri/cogAntiX1/scripts`  from `wallace` using subject ids in `/data/Luna/Projects/INACTIVE/ARCHIVE/Anti_State`
and sql database. Then copied over to `arnold`

## MRI
using functional.nii.gz and mprage.nii.gz located on `arnold` from S.Ordez's longitudial dataset.

## Behave
### Stimtimes
#### Initial
Originally S.Ordez used a master spreadsheet `MACRO_RenameRawDataFiles.xls` to get presentation order (`AJ:AM`). Cummulative timing of an order is described per sheet (e.g. `List01AV`) in `Anti_Mix_Desing_List.xslx`. This was combined with the scored eye tracking xls in to generate stim times.

#### Openfmri
openFMRI wants a per trial description for each subject.
