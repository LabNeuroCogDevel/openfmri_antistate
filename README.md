# behavioral scoring 

| score| desc             |long desc|
|---| -----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------        |
| -1| drop             |trail eye tracking was not usuable (blink, presaccade, bad tracking, etc)        |
|  0| incorrect        |only incorrect saccades, 0 sac were correct                                      |
|  1| correct          |first saccade is correct                                                         |
|  2| error corrected  |first saccade is an error, but a later saccade (+fix) is to the correct position |


 * Latency (in ms) is time from start of the trial until the first saccade. Error corrected is latency of the first (error) saccade.
 * Scoring was done manually using matlab+ilab. There is a program to score, but it was not used for the paper.
